Mastery:

To convert the given ambigous grammar to an unambigous one and implementing a LR parser.

Acceptable understanding:

Eventhough the grammar given is unambigous, take an approach to model a compiler where
lexical analysis happens and expressions are evaluated based on a precedence. 

Insufficient understanding:

This means developing an interpreter without any precedence given to the operators and also not storing 
the context of the variables used during an interpretor session.
