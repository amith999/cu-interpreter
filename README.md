The project is CU Interpreter.

This is written as a part of the Compiler Construction assignment.

The interpreter behaves like a Python interpreter for the following operations:

1. Print statements
2. Assigment operations
3. Arithmetic operations
4. Combination of assignment and  arithmetic operations
5. Combination of print and arithmetic operations


Some limitations in the code:

1. Inputs must be given in Quotes.
2. All the tokens (ie. operators and operands) must be space-separated.
